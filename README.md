# GUI-Development
A helpful and a collection of files containing python codes which can explain the basics of Tkinter module. Basically it is used to create GUI apps for various purposes. These uploaded files are free to use. The elements of Tkinter are known a widgets. That's all you need to know, now you can move to learning through all these files.

Files may be a lil bit unorganized but I made sure to mention them with their chapter numbers so it is easier to learn from basics to advance. Make sure you make your notes as well and read the documentation of Tkinter for more valuable and helping stuff. Good luck learning!
